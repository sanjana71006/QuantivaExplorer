Feature descriptions for AI-driven drug candidate ranking

1) drug_score
   Composite ranking score in [0,1], weighted by efficacy_index (45%), safety_index (35%),
   and complexity balance (20%). Higher is better.

2) safety_index
   Safety proxy in [0,1], combining inverse toxicity (if available) and Lipinski-style rule compliance.
   Higher indicates lower estimated risk and better oral-drug-likeness.

3) efficacy_index
   Efficacy proxy in [0,1], combining binding_score, stability, and solubility (normalized).
   Higher indicates better predicted therapeutic performance.

4) molecular_complexity
   Normalized structural complexity proxy in [0,1], derived from complexity, heavy atom count,
   and rotatable bond count. Used to avoid over- or under-complex candidates.

5) priority_rank
   Integer rank after sorting by drug_score descending. Rank 1 is highest priority.

Assumptions
- Datasets have heterogeneous schema and partially missing fields; robust median imputation is applied.
- Outliers are winsorized (1st-99th percentile) to stabilize real-time scoring.
- Delaney measured log solubility is min-max normalized to align with [0,1] solubility scale.
- Frontend compatibility is prioritized: snake_case columns, numeric consistency, CSV+JSON exports.
